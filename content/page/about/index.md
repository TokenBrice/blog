This blog covers in-depth DeFi protocol analyses, liquidity strategies, and live onchain experiments — check out the [shows](/shows/) to see DeFi in action.

I have followed the emergence of decentralized finance on Ethereum since its early days with the launch of MakerDAO. Since then, I have shared my understanding of it through various channels, including [live shows](/shows/), this blog, and my Twitter account.

All my actions and involvement in the space follow a single north star: maximizing the amount of trustless protocols available, and their recognition. To that end, I co-founded **[The DeFi Collective](https://deficollective.org/)** with [Nils Bundi](https://x.com/nilsbundi) and [Florian Prantl](https://x.com/floowp_) in October 2023, a nonprofit organization that harnesses DeFi to self-fund and support all relevant initiatives aimed at bolstering the most decentralized form of decentralized finance (DeFi).

I've spent years writing about DeFi, analyzing protocols, watching the compromises accumulate, and the promises evaporate. So I decided to jump to the builder side with friends made along the way to tackle what I think is the core existential issue of DeFi: the centralization of stablecoins, its top usecase.

If you've seen stablecoins abandon their foundations and felt something was wrong, you understand why we're here. If you believe that decentralization is a property of architecture, not marketing, you understand what we're building. **[Polaris](https://polarisfinance.io)** is not just yet another DeFi protocol: it's DeFi's immune system eruptive answer to the USDC/T virus. We've been in the trenches for too long to see the space we've dedicated our lives to end up captured, tamed and neutralized like the Internet was.

<span style="opacity:0.7; font-size:1.5rem !important; line-height:1.6; display:block;">After years watching stablecoins abandon decentralization for growth, we are building one that can't: harnessing an immutable core, free of counterparty, and self-scaling.</span>

## What do I do?

I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem while ensuring it remains aligned with its core values of trustless, accessibility, resilience and permissionlessness.
