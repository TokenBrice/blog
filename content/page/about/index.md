I have followed the emergence of decentralized finance on Ethereum since its early days with the launch of MakerDAO. Since then, I have shared my understanding of it through various channels, including live shows, this blog, and my Twitter account.

All my actions and involvement in the space follow a single north star: maximizing the amount of trustless protocols available, and their recognition. To that end, I co-founded **[The DeFi Collective](https://deficollective.org/)** with [Nils Bundi](https://x.com/nilsbundi) and [Florian Prantl](https://x.com/floowp_) in October 2023, a nonprofit organization that harnesses DeFi to self-fund and support all relevant initiatives aimed at bolstering the most decentralized form of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Our latest and most significant endeavour to date is DeFiScan, the "L2beat of protocol decentralization", launched in October 2024. **[DeFiScan](https://www.defiscan.info/)** provides users, DAOs, and institutions with an in-depth assessment of DeFi's protocols' decentralization. It's essentially the DeFi police, helping users determine the effective decentralization state of the main DeFi protocols, as the teams' communications on the matter tend to be unreliable, if not misleading.

## What do I do?

I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem while ensuring it remains aligned with its core values of trustless, accessibility, resilience and permissionlessness.

### Previous Occupations

#### GHO Liquidity Committee

At the request of the community, I joined the GHO Liquidity Committee in October 2023 to help repeg GHO and optimize its liquidity strategy. Witnessing serious waste and disorganization, I offered my services as a **["temporary and benevolent dictator"](https://x.com/TokenBrice/status/1719328410479059227)** to steer the Committee through a vote that passed.

Yet, even in such a role, my efforts were insufficient to counteract the stealthy work of professional politicians, who viewed the Committee as a golden goose to exploit, to the benefit of their numerous other commitments. Dishertened by the experience, which turned out to be more of a job for a politician than a liquidity manager, **[I've slammed the door of the Committee in February 2024](http://tokenbrice.xyz/farewell-glc/)**. I was not compensated in any manner for this engagement.

#### Liquity - Liquidity Engineer

I'm thrilled to have contributed to the growth of a project that upholds the root values of DeFi for more than 18 months. Liquity is an innovative lending protocol with a design maximizing resilience and decentralization while also offering no interest rate and high capital efficiency. Thanks to these properties, LUSD, the stablecoin output of the protocol, is the most decentralized and durable stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

#### ParaSwap - DAO Ops

I've also helped [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io), the decentralized exchange aggregator launch its DAO and quickstart the initial contributions.

#### Monolith - Community Manager

I was the Community Manager of [Monolith](https://monolith.xyz) for 18 months before I decided to focus on my community commitments. Since the beginning of my career, I have been working with startups to help them develop their online presence and implement sustainable digital strategies. 

Apart from decentralized finance, my technical expertise is focused on content production, community management and the logistics necessary to carry out these operations over time.
