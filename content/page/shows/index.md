I host live shows in English, relayed on [Twitter](https://x.com/TokenBrice) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Token_Brice), to explore DeFi protocols, discuss the latest developments, and show you how to harness DeFi practically.

## In The Arena

Where we actually do things onchain! The concept is simple: we have one dedicated wallet I fund with $3000 every month, so that, together, every two weeks we can deploy up to $1500 to DeFi protocols. Our job doesn't stop there, as we will track the positions together, decide when to terminate/take profit, and account for everything down to the gwei!

So I show how I harness DeFi, in the hope that this more practical take will inspire viewers to cross the chasm:
- Researching the protocols and potential positions beforehand
- Implementing the strategies
- Accounting and performance measurement
- Gas management

While I remain in control of the investment decisions since the goal is to show you how I use DeFi, you are welcome to suggest protocols and strategies that I will analyze live, and potentially allocate to.

[Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZz0VhvssvNOrf7DQu3wAzlJlVWEzEgP9) is a show made to share my DeFi discoveries: I feature protocols I've previously validated as interesting, with a 30-minute research session, and I discover them with you, live, alongside a team member or an expert on the protocol.
