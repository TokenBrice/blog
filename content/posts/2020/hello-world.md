Welcome to my humble domain, 

I'm thrilled to take this project live. As often with me, what started as a simple project ended up becoming... something else.

Initially, I started preparing this blog with a straightforward goal: I've been writing content on the web for a while, I wanted a place for all of it to live.

While I was at it, I looked at the different solutions available and realized it could be much more: it could turn into **a minimalistic yet sufficient approach to deliver content online, no strings attached.**

Without further ado, introducing:

### Tokenbrice.xyz, a blog respecting your privacy

> I made this blog as a callout: I'm no dev, I can barely code, and yet I was able to respect my reader's privacy, to an unprecedented level in the space.

To do so, TokenBrice.xyz relies on open source frameworks and solutions such as Hugo (rendering of the blog) or Matomo (privacy-conscious analytics).

For those interested, this blog implements full IP anonymisation, cookies non-propagation, in full compliance with the [CNIL guidelines](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/Configuration_piwik.pdf) - an independent French' administrative body acting as a privacy watchdog.

Tokenbrice.xyz is deployed on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). I'm not entirely happy with the infrastructure just yet, but I think it's significant progress compared to most existing websites:

### Be ruthless in asking for more privacy-conscious solutions

Nothing will be done, ever, even in the DeFi industry, unless us users make our concerns heard. **So, check your favourite projects' websites - and let them know how dirty they've been!**

You can use tools such as [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) to see how many trackers they have & block them!

![privacy-badger](/img/2020/hello-world/privacy-badger.png)
*A basic CoinTelegraph page has 14 trackers.*

However, please, assume best intentions: trackers and other privacy-intrusive devices are embedded in many systems, sometimes insidiously.  Do not assume a malicious intent as soon as you see a tracker. This tracker can be here for other reasons, such as:
- Lack of knowledge (I know nothing and made it)
- Lack of care for your privacy (probably)
- Lack of resources (so to them, privacy is not a priority)

> Let's spell it out in case it's not clear enough: there are no valid reasons for someone to ship a privacy-intrusive website nowadays especially if the site is "read-only", like this blog.

Yet there are still too many out there! 

So **let's call these potentially — ignorant, if not — careless, if not — lazy, if not — not-giving-a-fuck-about-privacy developers out.** 

I can barely touch an HTML file, and I did it — **so if you truly care, quit your bullshit and get to work.**

With ♥ love,

TokenBrice.
