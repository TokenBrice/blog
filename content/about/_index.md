## Who am I?

I have followed the emergence of decentralized finance on Ethereum since its early days with the launch of MakerDAO. I'm fortunate to be able to get by in English - so I had access to resources to understand what was going on.

At the time, quality articles, videos or podcasts in French dealing with decentralized finance were rare. Thanks to the launch of [DeFi France](https://discord.gg/3bWZcK2) (October 2019), [BanklessFR](https://banklessfr.substack.com/) (March 2020), this blog (May 2020), and [TheDailyGweiFR](https://thedailygweifr.substack.com/) (November 2020), and many other initiatives, the situation has now changed. 

üá´üá∑ My ambition is to make decentralized finance more accessible to all: the mission is very broad, so let's be chauvinistic - I focus most of my action on the francophone community. Nevertheless, I remain sensitive to any initiative that helps to promote decentralized finance among international communities.

## What do I do?

I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem by developing welcoming communities:

### DeFi France

DeFi France is the main French-speaking community to exchange about decentralized finance. 

I host the weekly live shows that take place on **[Monday at 5pm on the YouTube channel DeFi France](https://www.youtube.com/c/defifrance)** - after a press review of the French-speaking DeFi, we analyze a transversal theme or a given project.

### Luchadores

`UltraSoundNFT`
An NFT project that does things right: 100% onchain data (svg) and attribute generation during mint by a verifiable and auditable process (ChainLink VRF). Game in Play2Earn model to come.

### Previous Occupations

#### Liquity - Liquidity Engineer

I'm thrilled to have contributed to the growth of a project that upholds the root values of DeFi for more than 18 months. Liquity is an innovative lending protocol with a design maximizing resilience and decentralization while also offering no interest rate and high capital efficiency. Thanks to these properties, LUSD, the stablecoin output of the protocol, is the most decentralized and durable stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.

- [üì¢ Announcement]({{< relref path="/content/posts/2022/tokenbrice-liquity.md" >}})

#### ParaSwap - DAO Ops

I've also helped [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io), the decentralized exchange aggregator launch its DAO and quickstart the initial contributions.

#### Monolith - Community Manager

I was the Community Manager of [Monolith](https://monolith.xyz) for 18 months before I decided to focus on my community commitments. Since the beginning of my career, I have been working with startups to help them develop their online presence and implement sustainable digital strategies. 

Apart from decentralized finance, my technical expertise is focused on content production, community management and the logistics necessary to carry out these operations over time.
