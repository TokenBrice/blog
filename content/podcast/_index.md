![Abel Abstracts - Weekly DeFi Catchup with TokenBrice](/img/others/abel-abstracts.jpeg)

## Concept

Every week, Abel and I catch up and go over the new releases in the DeFi space, as well the articles & insights that caught our eyes: find it here. We keep it incremental and try to provide context on each of the topics we approach, as well as provide our listeners with resources to dive deeper. 

This page will organise this curated content registry following the order of the mentions in the podcast.
